# 📊 Descriptive Statistics Case Study on Employee Data  

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **descriptive statistics** using an employee dataset. The main objective is to uncover meaningful insights about employees’ demographics, salaries, and other characteristics using statistical techniques and visualizations.  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
- Conducted **data exploration** to understand the structure and quality of the dataset.  
- Applied **descriptive statistics** (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) to summarize employee attributes.  
- Used **visualizations** (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, bar plots) to interpret distributions and relationships.  
- Compared different employee characteristics such as **age, salary, experience, and department**.  
- Highlighted key trends and outliers in the dataset.  

## 📈 Analysis Performed  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Handled missing values and checked data types.  
   - Ensured dataset readiness for statistical analysis.  

2. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Distribution of salaries, employee ages, and experience levels.  
   - Summary statistics with central tendency and spread.  

3. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Relationship between **age and salary** using scatterplots.  
   - Department-wise salary distribution using boxplots.  
   - Correlation analysis between numerical variables.  

4. **Visual Storytelling**  
   - Histograms to study salary and age distributions.  
   - Boxplots to detect salary outliers.  
   - Scatterplots to explore employee salary trends with respect to age.  

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Salaries show variation across departments with some noticeable outliers.  
- Positive correlation between **employee age and salary**, but not perfectly linear.  
- Salary distribution is slightly skewed, indicating inequality in earnings.  
- Experience level plays an important role in salary differences.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step analysis and visualization
